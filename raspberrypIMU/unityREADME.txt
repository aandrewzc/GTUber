Unity Source Code

- this folder contains the C# scripts used in our project
- these are attached to various GameObjects in Unity to perform different actions
- many of the scripts are specific to the tutorial, and others are more general

NOTE: it may be difficult to understand the scripts without context of what object they are attached to
